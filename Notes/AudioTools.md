# **Project Goal:** ProjectAudio

**Core Features:**

1. **Content Ingestion & Library Management:**
    * **YouTube Downloading:** Can download videos from YouTube using a provided video ID, automatically extracting the audio track. (`yt_dlp`)
    * **Local File Handling:** Can process individual local audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`) or entire directories containing such files.
    * **Format Conversion & Standardization:** Automatically converts `.mp3` files to `.wav` format. Ensures all ingested audio is standardized to a 44.1kHz sample rate. (`librosa`, `soundfile`)
    * **Library Persistence:** Maintains a persistent database (`library/database.p`) using `pickle` to store metadata about each track (ID, name, source URL/path, paths to audio/video files) and its extracted features.
    * **Unique Identification:** Generates unique IDs for local files based on filename and a hash of the file path to prevent duplicates and manage them within the library structure. (`hashlib`)
    * **Command-Line Management:** Allows adding new content (YouTube IDs, file paths, directories) and removing existing items from the library via CLI arguments (`-a`, `-r`).

2. **Deep Audio Analysis & Feature Extraction:**
    * **Automated Analysis:** Automatically analyzes audio files upon addition to the library.
    * **Feature Caching:** Saves extracted audio features to separate `.a` files (e.g., `library/some_id.a`) using `pickle` to avoid redundant computations on subsequent runs.
    * **Source Separation (Stems):** Uses the Demucs neural network (`htdemucs_6s` model via `subprocess`) to separate audio files into distinct instrumental/vocal stems (default: bass, drums, guitar, other, piano, vocals). Stems are saved in the `separated/htdemucs_6s/<id>/` directory.
    * **Musical Structure Analysis:** Identifies structural segments (like verse, chorus) and their boundaries within the audio using `sf_segmenter`.
    * **Pitch & Key Detection:**
        * Performs detailed pitch tracking (fundamental frequency over time) using the Crepe neural network (`crepe`).
        * Calculates the overall average frequency and estimates the musical key (e.g., C4, G#3).
    * **Tempo & Beat Detection:** Detects the tempo (BPM) and the timing of beats within the audio using `librosa`.
    * **Timbre Analysis:** Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and their deltas (beat-synchronous) to represent the timbral quality of the sound using `librosa`. Calculates an average timbre value.
    * **Intensity/Loudness Analysis:**
        * Calculates beat-synchronous loudness/intensity using Constant-Q Transform (CQT) perceptual weighting (`librosa`). Calculates an average intensity value.
        * Calculates overall RMS volume and perceptual loudness after trimming silence (`librosa`, custom functions).
    * **Chroma Analysis:** Extracts beat-synchronous Chroma features representing the distribution of musical pitch classes (`librosa`). Calculates an average pitch class distribution value.

3. **Audio Processing & Manipulation:**
    * **Quantization:**
        * Aligns audio files (and their corresponding stems) to a regular beat grid.
        * Can quantize to a user-specified target BPM (`-t`) or keep the track's original detected tempo (`-k`).
        * Uses `librosa` for beat detection and `pyrubberband` for high-quality time-stretching based on a calculated time map aligning original beats to the target grid.
        * Saves the quantized full audio and all corresponding quantized stems to the `processed` directory with descriptive filenames including original/target BPM, key, etc.
    * **Audio-to-MIDI Conversion:**
        * Uses the Basic Pitch neural network (`basic_pitch`) to transcribe audio into MIDI files (`-m` flag).
        * This can be triggered during the initial analysis (`get_audio_features`) to convert the *original stems* or during quantization (`quantizeAudio`) to convert the *quantized full audio and quantized stems*.
        * MIDI files are saved alongside the audio they were generated from (either in `separated` or `processed` directories).

4. **Content-Based Search & Retrieval:**
    * **Similarity Search:** Allows searching the library for tracks musically similar to a specified query track (using its ID via `-s`).
    * **Feature-Based Comparison:** Similarity is primarily calculated based on the distance between the average `frequency` (pitch) of tracks.
    * **Tempo-Aware Search:** Optionally includes tempo difference as an additional search criterion (`-st` flag), prioritizing results that are similar in both pitch and tempo.
    * **Chained Results:** Can return a specified number (`-sa`) of related items, allowing for discovery chains (e.g., finding 10 tracks sequentially related to the initial query).
    * **Integrated Workflow:** Search results can be directly piped into the quantization process (`-q all` or specific IDs combined with `-s`), allowing users to find similar tracks and immediately quantize them to a common tempo.

5. **Technical Aspects:**
    * **Command-Line Interface:** All primary functions are controlled via command-line arguments (`argparse`).
    * **GPU Acceleration:** Leverages GPU capabilities (via `numba.cuda` and implicitly through `tensorflow` used by Crepe, Basic Pitch, and Demucs) for potentially faster processing, provided CUDA and TensorFlow with GPU support are set up correctly.
    * **Modularity:** Uses established external libraries for core ML and audio processing tasks.

In essence, ProjectAudio acts as an automated music analysis and processing pipeline, creating a rich, structured library from raw audio/video sources, enabling creative reuse and discovery based on musical content.
