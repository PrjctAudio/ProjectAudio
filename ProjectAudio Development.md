# 🧠 Training a Custom Model for Song Structure Recognition

---

Creating a model that identifies **song sections**—such as *Intro*, *Verse*, *Chorus*, and *Bridge*—requires audio analysis, machine learning, and domain-specific design. Below is a high-level roadmap for building such a system.

---

## 1. 📦 Data Collection

You’ll need a dataset of songs annotated with structural labels (e.g., timestamps for *Intro*, *Verse*, etc.).

- **Sources**:
  - Public datasets (e.g., SALAMI dataset, RWC music database)
  - Manual annotation using tools like Audacity, Sonic Visualiser, or custom labeling interfaces
- **Considerations**:
  - Annotations must be time-aligned with the audio
  - Label consistency is critical across the dataset

---

## 2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing

Standardize the dataset before training:

- Convert audio files to a **consistent format** (e.g., `.wav`, 22kHz, mono)
- Normalize volume and sample rate
- Use timestamp annotations to segment or label frames/windows in the audio

---

## 3. 🎼 Feature Extraction

Extract useful audio features that help distinguish sections.

### ✅ Recommended Features

- **Spectral**:
  - MFCCs
  - Chroma
  - Spectral Contrast
  - Tonnetz

- **Rhythmic**:
  - Beat timings
  - Tempogram
  - Onset strength

- **Harmonic**:
  - Key signature
  - Chord progression

- **Timbral**:
  - Spectral centroid, rolloff, flux
  - Zero-crossing rate

> Use `librosa`, `madmom`, or `essentia` for feature extraction.

---

## 4. 🧠 Model Selection

Choose a neural network suited for temporal sequence classification:

| Model Type | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| **CNN** | Effective for short-term feature maps like spectrograms |
| **RNN (LSTM/GRU)** | Captures temporal relationships over time |
| **CRNN** | Combines CNN’s spatial awareness with RNN’s temporal modeling |
| **Transformer** | Emerging choice for long-range audio dependencies |

---

## 5. 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model

Steps to train:

1. **Split Dataset**:
   - Train / Validation / Test
2. **Label Generation**:
   - Convert time-aligned labels into frame-wise or chunk-wise targets
3. **Model Compilation**:

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

   model = Sequential()
   model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(timesteps, features), return_sequences=True))
   model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
   model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```

4. **Train & Monitor**:
   - Use callbacks (e.g., EarlyStopping)
   - Track metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix

---

## 6. 🧪 Evaluation

- Use the **Test Set** to evaluate performance on unseen data
- Compute:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - F1 Score
- Visualize predictions using timeline plots to compare ground truth vs. predicted sections

---

## 7. 🔁 Iteration & Refinement

- Augment the dataset with new or synthetic samples
- Experiment with different:
  - Architectures
  - Feature combinations
  - Window/frame sizes
- Address overfitting or class imbalance using techniques like dropout or class weighting

---

## 🧰 Transfer Learning

Accelerate development using **pre-trained models**:

### 🔖 Pre-Trained Music Models

- [**Musicnn**](https://github.com/jordipons/musicnn)
  - CNN-based music tagging model; great for extracting deep audio features

- **VGGish**
  - General-purpose audio embedding model trained on YouTube-8M

- Use these models as **feature extractors** and train your own classification head on top

---

## 🎚️ Source Separation Aids

Use source separation tools to enhance structure detection:

- **Spleeter** (by Deezer)
- **Demucs**
- Separate:
  - Vocals
  - Instruments (drums, bass, keys)
- Analyze structure of individual stems to identify repeated patterns (e.g., vocal choruses)

---

## 🎼 Heuristic + ML Hybrid Approach

Combine ML with **music theory heuristics**:

- **Choruses** often:
  - Repeat
  - Are louder
  - Have richer harmonic content

- Post-process ML predictions using:
  - Repetition analysis
  - Harmonic richness
  - Intensity curves

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

| Challenge | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **📉 Data Scarcity** | Labeled datasets are limited and time-consuming to build |
| **📏 Subjectivity** | Song structure is often subjective and ambiguous |
| **🎯 Class Imbalance** | Choruses may be more frequent than bridges or outros |
| **🔊 Audio Variation** | Instrumentation and mixing vary widely across genres |

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Training a custom model for music segmentation is a complex but rewarding task. Success depends on:

- High-quality, well-annotated data
- Careful feature selection
- Choosing the right modeling approach
- Iterative development with human-in-the-loop feedback

> Combining deep learning with music domain knowledge often produces the best results.

# 🧩 In-Depth Details: ProjectAudio

## 1. 📥 Ingest Audio Library

### 1.1 🎼 Analyze Audio Features

To analyze audio features, follow these steps:

#### 🔧 Preprocessing

- Convert audio files to a uniform format (`.wav`) and sampling rate (e.g., 22,050 Hz mono) to ensure consistency.

#### 📐 Feature Extraction (using `librosa`)

- **Key Signature Detection**:
  - Use chroma-based features + key detection algorithms.
- **BPM (Tempo) Detection**:
  - Detect onsets and calculate tempo.
- **Time Signature Detection**:
  - Analyze beat intervals to infer time signature (often heuristic-based).
- **Genre Classification**:
  - Extract MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast, and zero-crossing rate
  - Feed features into a machine learning classifier

```python
import librosa

y, sr = librosa.load("audio_file.wav")
tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)
print(f"Estimated Tempo: {tempo:.2f} BPM")
```

---

### 1.2 🧬 Audio Fingerprinting

Use tools like `Dejavu`, `AcoustID`, or `chromaprint` to:

- Generate a unique fingerprint for each track
- Match against known tracks
- Enable similarity search and duplicate detection

---

### 1.3 🧠 Create Song Structure Labels

Detect musical sections: intro, verse, chorus, bridge, etc.

#### Approach

- Extract time-based features: MFCCs, beat strength, chroma
- Segment audio using self-similarity matrices, novelty curves
- Train models (CNNs, RNNs, or CRNNs) on annotated data
- Output time-aligned section labels for each track

---

## 2. 🗂️ Organize Analyzed Audio Library

Use the extracted metadata to sort files into structured directories.

#### Example: Sorting by Key

```python
import os
import shutil

# audio_files = {file_path: key}
for file_path, key in audio_files.items():
    destination = f"sorted_library/{key}/"
    os.makedirs(destination, exist_ok=True)
    shutil.move(file_path, destination)
```

Other directory levels can include `Genre`, `BPM`, and `Time Signature`.

- Add error handling to manage duplicates
- Use logging to track changes

---

## 3. 🔎 Implement Search Features

Build a search engine to query metadata:

### Backend

- REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Search filters: key, tempo, time signature, genre
- Support “find similar songs” using audio fingerprint similarity

### Database

- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Index fields like BPM, key, genre for performance

---

## 4. ⚙️ Optional Features

### 4.1 ✂️ Extract Song Sections

After song structure analysis:

- Use timestamps to isolate sections (e.g., chorus)
- Extract clips with `pydub`

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

song = AudioSegment.from_wav("song.wav")
chorus = song[start_ms:end_ms]
chorus.export("chorus.wav", format="wav")
```

---

### 4.2 🔀 Split Songs into Stems

Use `Spleeter`:

```python
from spleeter.separator import Separator

separator = Separator("spleeter:2stems")  # Options: 2stems, 4stems, 5stems
separator.separate_to_file("audio_file.mp3", "output_directory")
```

Output includes separated files for:

- Vocals
- Accompaniment (or individual instruments if using 4/5 stems)

---

### 4.3 ⏱️ Change Tempo

Use `pyrubberband` to time-stretch audio:

```python
import pyrubberband as pyrb

y_stretched = pyrb.time_stretch(y, sr, rate=1.5)  # 50% faster
```

---

### 4.4 🎚️ Change Key

Shift pitch by semitones:

```python
y_shifted = pyrb.pitch_shift(y, sr, n_steps=2)  # Up 2 semitones
```

Combine with BPM modification for remixing and track compatibility.
